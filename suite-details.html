<h1 id="rdfa_test_suite">RDFa Test Suite</h1>

<p>The RDFa Test Suite is a set of Web Services, markup and tests that can 
be used to verify RDFa Processor conformance to the set of specifications
that constitute RDFa 1.1. The goal of the suite is to provide an easy and 
comprehensive RDFa testing solution for developers creating RDFa Processors.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>The RDFa Test suite allows developers to mix and match RDFa processor endpoints
with different RDFa versions and Host Languages.</p>

<p>The RDFa Test Suite is an single-page HTML application driving the entire
process.</p>

<p>The page is loaded with the complete lists of tests associated with different RDFa versions and host languages.
To execute a test, the application uses the <code>processorUrl</code> and appends URI query parameters identifying the test source and other necessary parameters, upon which the processor will return the parsed RDF represented as either <a href="">N-Triples</a> or <a href="">Turtle</a>. As the processor executes in HTML, it is important that the processor return the header <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>.
The application also fetches an associated SPARQL query, which
uses an <em>ASK</em> form to return true or false.</p>

<p>The test-suite is implemented using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and  <a href="https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js/">rdflib.js</a>.
The user interface is implemented in JavaScript using
<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap.js</a> and <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a>.</p>

<p>The test files are managed statically using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rake_(software">Rake task</a>) used to build version- and language-specific test files.</p>

<p>The HTML application is implemented principally in JavaScript using <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a> as a model-viewer-controller, which downloads the test suite manifest and creates a simple user interface using <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap.js</a> to run tests, or get test details.</p>

<p>Processing happens in the following order:</p>

<pre><code>RDFa Test Suite | RDFa Website | RDFa Processor
load webpage    -&gt;
                &lt;- test scaffold
load manifest   -&gt;
                &lt;- JSON-LD manifest
run test        -&gt; Load SPARQL query.
                                -&gt; Process referenced
                                   test document and
                                   return RDF with
                                   Content-Type indicating
                                &lt;- format.
SPARQL runs with
returned document
returning _true_
or _false_.

<h2 id="how_to_add_a_unit_test">How to add a unit test</h2>

<p>In order to add a unit test, you must follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pick a new unit test number. For example - 250. To be consistent, please use
the next available unit test number.</li>
<li>Create a markup file in the tests/ directory with a .txt extension. 
For example: tests/250.txt</li>
<li>Create a SPARQL query file in the tests/ directory with a .sparql extension.
For example: tests/250.sparql</li>
<li>Add your test to manifest.ttl and indicate the host language(s) and version(s) for which
it applies. For example, if you would like your example to only apply to HTML4,
you would specify <code>rdfatest:hostLanguage "html4";</code> in the test case entry.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are three classifications for Unit Tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>required - These are tests that are required for proper operation per the
       appropriate RDFa specification.</li>
<li>optional - These are tests for optional features supported by some RDFa 
       Processors.</li>
<li>buggy    - These are tests that are buggy or are not considered valid test
       cases by all RDFa processor maintainers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The test suite is designed to empower RDFa processor maintainers to create
and add tests as they see fit. This may mean that the test suite may become
unstable from time to time, but this approach has been taken so that the 
long-term goal of having a comprehensive test suite for RDFa can be achieved
by the RDFa community.</p>

<p>When running locally, after adding a unit test, run <code>rake cache:clear</code> to remove cached files and ensure that necessary HTTP resources are regenerated. For the deployed website, this happens automatically each time a Git commit is pushed to the server.</p>

<h2 id="how_to_create_a_processor_endpoint">How to create a processor endpoint.</h2>

<p>The Test Suite operates by making a call to a <em>processor endpoint</em> with a query parameter that indicates
the URL of the test document to be processed. Within the test suite, a text box (upper right-hand corner)
allows a processor endpoint to be selected or added manually. It is presumed that the endpoint URL ends
with a query parameter to which a test URL can be appended. For example, the <em>pyrdfa</em> endpoint is
defined as follows: <code>http://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/extract?uri=</code>. When invoked, the URL of an actual
test will be appended, such as the following:
<code>http://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/extract?uri=http://rdfa.info/test-suite/test-cases/xml/rdfa1.1/0001.xml</code>.</p>

<p>Everything required by a processor can be presumed from the content of the document provided, however
the test suite will also set a <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP header appropriate for the document provided, these include
* application/xhtml+xml,
* application/xml,
* image/svg+xml, and
* text/html</p>

<p>The processor is called with HTTP Accept header indicating appropriate result formats (currently,
<code>text/turtle</code> (indicating <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle</a>),
<code>application/rdf+xml</code> (indicating <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/">RDF/XML</a>), and
<code>text/plain</code> (indicating <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntriples">N-Triples</a>)), and the processor may
respond with an appropriate RDF format. Processors <em>SHOULD</em> set the HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> of the resulting
document to the associated document Mime Type.</p>

<p>In some cases, the test suite may add additional query parameters to the endpoint URL to test different
required or optional behaviors, these include <code>rdfagraph</code>, taking a value of <code>original</code>, <code>processor</code>, or
<code>original,processor</code> to control the processor output
(see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/#accessing-the-processor-graph">RDFa Core 1.1 Section 7.6.1</a>).
Also, <code>vocab_expansion</code> taking any value is used
to control optional RDFa vocabulary expansion
(see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-core/#s_expansion_control">RDFa Core 1.1 Section 10.2</a>).</p>

<p>To add a processor to the test suite, add to the object definition in
<code>processors.json</code> in alphabetical order. This is currently defined as follows:</p>

<p>The <code>doap</code> is the IRI defining the processor. It should be an information resource resulting in a
<a href="https://github.com/edumbill/doap/wiki">DOAP</a> project description, and will be used when formatting reports.</p>

<p>If the DOAP project description location differs from the identifying IRI, set that location in <code>doap_url</code></p>

<h2 id="document_caching">Document caching</h2>

<p>Test cases are provided with HTTP ETag headers and expiration values.
Processors <em>MAY</em> cache test case documents but <em>MUST</em> validate the document using HTTP HEAD or conditional GET
operations.</p>

<h2 id="crazy_ivan">Crazy Ivan</h2>

<p>The test suite is termed <em>Crazy Ivan</em> because of an unusual maneuver popularized in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099810/quotes?qt=qt0458296">The Hunt for Red October</a>
and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi6BLxusAM8">Firefly</a>. It is a term used to detect problems that are hiding, which is what the test suite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seaman Jones: Conn, sonar! Crazy Ivan! 
Capt. Bart Mancuso: All stop! Quick quiet! [the ships engines are shut down completely] 
Beaumont: What&#8217;s goin&#8217; on? 
Seaman Jones: Russian captains sometime turn suddenly to see if anyone&#8217;s behind them. We call it &#8220;Crazy Ivan.&#8221; The only thing you can do is go dead. Shut everything down and make like a hole in the water. 
Beaumont: So what&#8217;s the catch? 
Seaman Jones: The catch is, a boat this big doesn&#8217;t exactly stop on a dime&#8230; and if we&#8217;re too close, we&#8217;ll drift right into the back of him. </p>
